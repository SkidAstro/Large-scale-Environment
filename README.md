This folder contains programs that are associated with using galaxy position information to create large scale sky structures. Specifically, those structures (environments) include: Galaxies Near Filaments (GNF), Tendrils & Void. 

Main.py - This program should sort the given galaxies into the various environments and print out the galaxy information.

Main Length Specs.py - This program should calculate the distance to the nearest filament for each relevant galaxy

Match3D DISTANCE.py - This program should match the galaxies that have been sorted into an environment with its corresponding distance from a filament (?)
